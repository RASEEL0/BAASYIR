# BAASYIR 

In this project, we aim to address the challenges faced by blind individuals due to resource limitations by introducing the 'Baasyir' smart glasses system, incorporating Deep Learning for obstacle detection. 
The system aims to assist blind people in recognizing objects, overcoming obstacles, and enhancing their independence. We proposed an approach that integrates two models the YOLO version 7 real-time object detection algorithm and the YOLOv7-tiny model, supported by an extensive literature review and we used relevant datasets. The developed approach's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, IoU, and mAP. We conducted multiple experiments with YOLOv7 and YOLOv7-tiny implementation and parameter optimization on target datasets that showed promising results, achieving a higher mAP. The object detection models YOLOv7\_Furniture, YOLOv7-tiny\_Furniture, YOLOv7\_Baasyir, and YOLOv7-tiny\_Baasyir achieved detection accuracies of 75.3\%, 71.1\%, 49.4\%, and 42.7\%, respectively, on their respective datasets. Following the implementation of the object detection model, the Baasyir smart glass system was developed on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. We concluded by suggesting potential future directions and areas for further research in this field.
